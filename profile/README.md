**ðŸŒ­ This account is strictly for my security research 
that I don't post on my main GitHub! ðŸŒ­**

**My main account**: [Reigz](https://github.com/reigz)

Feel free to browse, lol -> what you can find here:
1. [CVE Proof-of-Concepts](https://github.com/smurf-reigz/security/tree/main/proof-of-concepts) that I authored but I don't find the value (low hanging fruits or opensource projects that don't have a lot of ðŸŒŸ).
    > If I think the security impact is high or the vulnerability is on a GitHub page with many ðŸŒŸ, I post them on my main account (for internet points ofc)
2. Code Dumps that I might come back later to.
3. Fun stuff that I won't be working soon.
4. List might change in the future, depends ðŸ˜‰
